# SimpleImageViewer
What you see here is a basic ImageViewer written with the help of the python module tkinter.

The ExplanationPictures are used for this ReadMe file. In CityPics we find 12 pictures from Tokyo and which will be displayed by our ImageViewer.py file


1.Next, Back and Exit Button:
----------------------------------------
Part of the ImageViewer are a next, back and also an exit button. And to know at which image we currently are, also a statusbar is included.

When reaching the last picture, the next button will be disabled, and the same applies to the forward button, if we are at the first picture.

2.Background_color:
----------------------------------------
It might be useful for some to also change the background color of the ImageViewer. Thats why you can choose between 4 kinds of background color in the menubar:

----------------------------------------
And last but not least, while resizing the window of the GUI, also the buttons will be resized.
